# StoryTeller-for-ASD-kids
In this project, We developed an AR application for autistic children, to interact with patients in the form of storytelling, and to train their cognitive abilities. The application intends to improve their behavior, communication, and social interaction with the help of parents and teachers. The application for the mobile phone could be found in the latest releases.
